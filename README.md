# Pokemon Team Builder 

A little Python script that will give you a random team from the game you're playing that will always have a type advantage over opposing Pokemon.

## Motivation 

I wanted to incorporate an API call in a program that I made, which I did in 'api_calls.py' to create the Pokedexes that worked for me.

## Build Status

Completed and working.

## Tech/Frameworks Used

Python to write the script. An understanding of APIs to use PokeAPI.co to get data. 

## How To Use 

If you have Python installed on your PC, clone the repo, and run 'main.py' from your terminal by running 

> py main.py

'api_calls.py' can be used to get data from PokeAPI.co in the future when they update their dataset with new games/Pokemon.
